Machine Learning Project - Wine Quality Prediction
Here I used two datasets red wine and white wine.
- Build a model by using Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classification for predicting wine type 
- Build a model by using Decision Tree Classification and Random Forest Classification for predicting wine quality.
